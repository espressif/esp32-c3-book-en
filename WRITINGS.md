# ✍️ Writing your own section

If you want to add a new section/chapter for topics you'd like to introduce, we suggest creating a new branch named after the "TOPIC" and using the [writing template folder](src/writing_template/) in the `src` folder to start drafting.

Once you have finished the writing, submit a pull request to let us know! 🎉 🎉 🎉
