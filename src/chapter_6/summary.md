# Summary

ESP32-C3 has a rich set of peripheral interfaces, which can be used in different application scenarios, such as screen display, sensor data collection, audio playback, etc. For smart light applications, LED PWM controllers are usually used to implement LED dimming drivers.

After learning the driver development steps in this chapter, you should be able to program on your own to control LED lights. In subsequent chapters, we will introduce commonly used wireless communication technologies and protocols in IoT, and how to apply them in the smart light project.
