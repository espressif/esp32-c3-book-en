# Cloud Data Communication Protocols

Section 9.1 described what remote control was. As the topological
structure of remote control shows, the smartphone and the controlled
device are not directly connected. They are connected to the cloud
server, and the data sent by both are forwarded by the cloud. Then, what
is the protocol for connecting the device to the cloud? What is the
protocol for data communication? Only by figuring out these protocols
can you have a basic understanding of remote control.

At present, common protocols for connecting devices to the cloud are the
MQTT protocol and HTTP protocol. This chapter will only cover the former
as the latter has been introduced in Chapter 8.
