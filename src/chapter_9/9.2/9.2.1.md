# MQTT Introduction

MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport) is a server-client
publish-subscribe messaging transmission protocol. It is open, simple,
lightweight, standardized, and easy to implement. These characteristics
make it a standard IoT transmission protocol that is ideal for
resource-constrained devices. The protocol was released by IBM in 1999.
At present, it has been developed to v5.x, and ESP-IDF supports v3.1.1.
The two versions have significant differences and are not compatible
with each other. Most cloud platforms currently still rely on the older
v3.x version. Therefore, in this chapter, we will be focusing on MQTT
v3.x.

The MQTT protocol runs over the TCP protocol. It has the following
features:

-   The publish/subscribe pattern which supports one-to-many message
    distribution and decoupling of applications.
-   A messaging transport that is agnostic to the content of the
    payload.
-   Three qualities of service (QoS) for message delivery.
-   Small transport overhead and protocol exchanges minimised to reduce
    network traffic.
-   Will messages to notify interested parties when an abnormal
    disconnection occurs.
