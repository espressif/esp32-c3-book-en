# üßê Practice: Remote Control through ESP RainMaker

After reading the previous chapters, you should have a basic
understanding of Wi-Fi configuration and MQTT protocol. In this section,
we will delve deeper into the Smart Light project discussed in this
book. We will utilise the ESP RainMaker to provide the smart light with
more functions, including remote control, local control, OTA upgrade,
and scheduling. Besides, we will enable third-party applications Alexa
and Google Home to control the smart light using Skill and facilitate
voice control using voice assistants such as Alexa and Google Assistant.

A standard voice assistant allows you to switch a smart light on or off,
as well as adjust its brightness. If the smart light supports colour and
colour temperature adjustments, you can send specific voice commands to
alter these settings. Moreover, you can use voice assistant-enabled
speakers such as Echo and Nest to discover and control the light.
