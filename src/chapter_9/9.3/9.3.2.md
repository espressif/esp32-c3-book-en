# Generating Certificates Locally

OpenSSL is an open-source Secure Socket Layer (SSL) cryptographic
library that provides functions for algorithms, key and certificate
encapsulation management, and SSL protocol implementation. It consists
of three parts: an SSL protocol library, command-line tools for
applications, and cryptographic algorithm libraries. The following
examples demonstrate how use it to generate certificates and keys on
Linux.

## 1. Generating private keys for the certificate

This command generates a private key (2048 bits) for the certificate. The public key can be extracted from it.

<pre><code>$ <b>openssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048</b>
Generating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus
...........................................................................................................................+++
.......+++
e is 65537 (0x10001)</code></pre>

This command generates a private key (2048 bits) for the server certificate.

<pre><code>$ <b>openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048</b>
Generating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus
................+++
........................+++
e is 65537 (0x10001)</code></pre>

This command generates a private key (2048 bits) for the client certificate.

<pre><code>$ <b>openssl genrsa -out client.key 2048</b>
Generating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus
...............................................+++
........................................................+++
e is 65537 (0x10001)</code></pre>

The recommended minimum key length for RSA algorithm is 2048 bits. If the key length is 1024 bits, `mbedtls` will reject TLS negotiation due to low security.

## 2. Generating CSRs for the certificate

This command generates a certificate sign request (CSR) that is required
by the CA certificate. Enter the required information as prompted. The
`Organization Name` can be entered as desired because this is only for
local use.

<pre><code>$ <b>openssl req -out ca.csr -key ca.key -new</b>
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:<b>CN</b>
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:
Locality Name (eg, city) []:
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:<b>IOT Certificate Test</b>
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:
Email Address []:

Please enter the following 'extra' attributes to be sent with your certificate request
A challenge password []:
An optional company name []:</code></pre>

This command generates a CSR that is required by the server certificate.
Note that the `Common Name` field should be filled with the domain name
or IP address of the server.

<pre><code>$ <b>openssl req -out server.csr -key server.key -new</b>
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter â€˜.â€™, the field will be left blank.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:<b>CN</b>
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:
Locality Name (eg, city) []:
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:<b>MQTT Server</b>
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:<b>192.168.3.4</b>
Email Address []:

Please enter the following 'extra' attributes to be sent with your certificate request
A challenge password []:
An optional company name []:</code></pre>

## 3. Generating CA certificate, server certificate, and client certificate

This command generates the CA certificate `ca.crt`.

<pre><code>$ <b>openssl x509 -req -in ca.csr -out ca.crt -sha256 -days 5000 -signkey ca.key</b>
Signature ok
subject=/C=CN/ST=Some-State/O=IOT Certificate Test
Getting Private key</code></pre>

This command generates the server certificate `server.crt`.

<pre><code>$ <b>openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -out server.crt -sha256 -CAcreateserial -days 5000 -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key</b>
Signature ok
subject=/C=CN/ST=Some-State/O=MQTT Server/CN=192.168.3.4
Getting CA Private Key</code></pre>

This command generates the client certificate `client.crt`.

<pre><code>$ <b>openssl x509 -req -in client.csr -out client.crt -sha256 -CAcreateserial -days 5000 -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key</b>
Signature ok
subject=/C=CN/ST=Some-State/O=MQTT Client/CN=192.168.3.5
Getting CA Private Key</code></pre>

> ðŸ“Œ **NOTE**
>
> Do not use the SHA1 algorithm, as `mbedtls` may reject TLS negotiation due to low security.
