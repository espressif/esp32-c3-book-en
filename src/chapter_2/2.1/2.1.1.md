# Basic Modules for Common IoT Devices

Software and hardware development of IoT devices include the following basic modules:

## Data collection

As the bottom layer of the IoT architecture, the IoT devices of the perception & control layer connect sensors and devices through their chips and peripherals to achieve data collection and operation control.

## Account binding and initial configuration

For most IoT devices, account binding and initial configuration are completed in one operational process, for example, connecting devices with users by configuring Wi-Fi network.

## Interaction with IoT cloud platforms

To monitor and control IoT devices, it is also necessary to connect them to IoT cloud platforms, in order to give commands and report status through interaction between each other.

## Device control

When connected with IoT cloud platforms, devices can communicate with the cloud and be registered, bound, or controlled. Users can query product status and carry out other operations on the smartphone app through IoT cloud platforms or local communication protocols.

## Firmware upgrade

IoT devices can also achieve firmware upgrade based on manufacturersâ€™ needs. By receiving commands sent by the cloud, firmware upgrade and version management will be realized. With this firmware upgrade feature, you can continuously enhance the functions of IoT devices, fix defects, and improve user experience.
