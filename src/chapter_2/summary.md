# Summary

In this chapter, we first expounded on the basic components and functional modules of an IoT project, then introduced the Smart Light case for practice, referring to its structure, functions, hardware preparation, and development process. Readers can draw inferences from the practice and become confident to carry out IoT projects with minimum mistakes in the future.
