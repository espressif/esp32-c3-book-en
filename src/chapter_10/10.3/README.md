# Analysis of the Appâ€™s Functional Requirements

In the previous sections, we have introduced how to create a new app
project, along with its structure and lifecycle. Now, to help you
understand the development of app functionalities more concretely, we
have included the source code of the smartphone app project in our
GitHub, and you can import it into Android Studio/Xcode to run for for
reference.

The main function of the smartphone app is to configure devices
developed based on Espressif's chips and modules to a designated router,
and send commands through the app to control these devices, such as
smart lights and sensors. Another function is to set the device status
at a specified time using the scheduling module, for example, to turn on
the water heater on the way home, so that hot water will be available as
soon as you arrive.
