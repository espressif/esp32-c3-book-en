# Analysis of Device Provisioning and Binding Requirements

There are two ways to provision a device. One is **Bluetooth
provisioning**, where the app connects and communicates with the device
through Bluetooth, provides provisioning data for the device, and allows
it to join the network. Another way is **SoftAP provisioning**, where
the device starts a **Wi-Fi hotspot** for the smartphone to connect and
communicate with each other. Once the device is provisioned, enter PIN
to bind the device over cloud. The analysis of device provisioning and
binding requirements is shown in Figure 10.14.

-   For Bluetooth provisioning, the app needs to implement Bluetooth
    scanning, connection, subscription, packet transmission and other
    functions.

-   For SoftAP provisioning, the app needs to navigate to the system
    setting interface, connect to the device's Wi-Fi hotspot, and
    display information about the connected Wi-Fi hotspot.

-   The implementation of device binding after provisioning is the same
    for both ways and can be reused.
