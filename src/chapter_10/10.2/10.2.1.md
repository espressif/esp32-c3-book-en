# Preparing for Android Development

The Android app may be developed on Linux, Mac, or Windows using Android
Studio. It should be targeted at Android 6.0 and above, and can be built
with Java and Kotlin.

Kotlin is preferred for developing the Android app. As a JVM-oriented
language, it is fully compatible with Java, and offers more flexible
syntax and powerful features. Back in 2017, Google announced that it
would support Kotlin on Android as a first-class language. With
experience in Java development, you can easily get started with Kotlin.
