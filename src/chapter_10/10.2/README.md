# Creating a New Smartphone App Project

Now that we have learned about the development of Android and iOS
project, let's start creating a new app project. Since the provisioning
function of the app requires a Bluetooth module, simulator does not meet
the demand. Please prepare a smartphone for the development and
debugging of the app.

Before creating a new smartphone app project, you need to download the
corresponding development tools. IDE tools have integrated all the
necessary environments, and do not require setting environment variables
and other tedious work.
