# Smartphone App Development

In Chapter 9, we introduced how to control devices through the cloud
using Wi-Fi technologies, as well as how to communicate with the cloud
using MQTT protocol and TLS protocol to ensure data security and
validity.

In this chapter, we will learn to develop our own smartphone application
to wirelessly control the smart lights. It should enable users to
connect smart home devices with the control system based on Wi-Fi,
Bluetooth, and other wireless communication technologies, so as to
control these devices and transfer data easily even if they are
thousands of miles away. It depends on network and data and obtains
detailed information of devices through the smartphone.

In daily life, we may simply send commands to the built-in Wi-Fi module
in home appliances through wireless network to implement corresponding
control, such as switching on/off a smart light, or setting its color or
brightness.
