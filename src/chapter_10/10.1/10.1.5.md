# Lifecycle of iOS ViewController

The lifecycle of the ViewController refers to the lifecycle of the views
it controls. When the state of a view changes, the ViewController will
automatically call a series of methods in response to the change. The
lifecycle of the ViewController is shown in Figure 10.4.

Each method is used as follows:

-   `init()` initializes relevant, critical data.

-   `loadView()` initializes the view. This method should not be called
    directly, but automatically by the system.

-   `viewDidLoad()` indicates that the view is loaded, but not yet been
    displayed on the screen. By overriding this method, you can perform
    additional initialization on views, such as removing some views,
    modifying constraints, loading data, etc.

-   `viewWillAppear()` indicates that the view is about to be displayed
    on the screen. You may use this method to change the orientation or
    style of the status bar.

-   `viewDidApper()` indicates that the view has been displayed on the
    screen. You may use this method to modify how the view is presented.

-   `viewWillDisappear()` indicates that the view is about to disappear,
    be covered, or be hidden.

-   `viewDidDisappear()` indicates that the view has disappeared, been
    covered, or been hidden.
