# Introduction to Smartphone App Development

In the *Practice* section of Chapter 9, we explained how to use ESP
RainMaker client to wirelessly control the Smart Light project. In this
chapter, we will turn to its smartphone app and present its development
process in detail.

The app project is available for both iOS and Android. It is an
end-to-end solution provided by Espressif to remotely control and
monitor IoT devices based on Espressif chips without any configuration
required in the cloud.

The source code of the Android app is stored in the [`book-esp32c3-iot-projects/phone_app/app_android`](https://github.com/espressif/book-esp32c3-iot-projects/tree/main/phone_app/app_android) directory.

Don't worry if you have not developed any Android or iOS apps before. In
this chapter, we will elaborate on how to develop a smartphone app
starting from creating a new app project. After you have a basic
understanding of Android and iOS application development, we will dive
deeper into the main features of this open-source project.
