# Overview of Smartphone App Development

The smartphone app for controlling smart lights includes both iOS and
Android versions. The iOS version is developed in Xcode and written in
Swift, whereas the Android version is developed in Android Studio and
programmed in Java. In this chapter, we will first make prototype
diagrams according to requirement documents and API documents, then
design interfaces and interactions, and finally implement the design for
each interface based on prototype diagrams. We will use Git to manage
codes, get updated versions, compare versions, and commit changes.

The implementation of the smartphone app requires permission to access
the smartphone's camera, local network, location, Bluetooth, etc. It is
based on network request, ESP Provision SDK for provisioning, data
parsing, pop-ups, and other third-party frameworks, and involves the
development of functions such as device list, scheduling, user centre,
login and registration.

In the following sections, we will introduce the project structure and
the lifecycle of the smartphone app in Android and iOS, so that you can
develop apps more easily with a preliminary understanding.
