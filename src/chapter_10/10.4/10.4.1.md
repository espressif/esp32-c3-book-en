# Introduction to RainMaker APIs

RainMaker cloud supports two types of APIs: `Unauthenticated` and
`Authenticated`. Unauthenticated APIs do not have any authentication
tokens in the HTTP header and will receive `access_token` in the
response when users log in successfully. Authenticated APIs are marked
in the `Swagger` file with a "lock" sign in the front. Their
`access_token` needs to be passed for authentification in the
`Authorization` HTTP header.

For RainMaker API documentation, please refer to <https://swaggerapis.rainmaker.espressif.com>.

When smartphones communicate with the RainMaker cloud, the underlying
protocol is HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). HTTPS can
authenticate the server to protect the privacy and integrity of the
exchange data. The HTTPS body received by the RainMaker cloud is in JSON
format.
