# Development of User Management
 
After going through the analysis of the project's functional
requirements in Section 10.3, you should already have an overall picture
of modules and functions that need to be developed, as well as the
required frameworks and third-party libraries. In this section, we will
put all the modules and functions into code. Based on the new projects
and permissions configured before, now you need to know the classes
designed for each interface and associations between them, in order to
achieve better operation through code. The code for each function would
be encapsulated to be reused and modularised.
