# Initiating Communication via Smartphone

Android and iOS provide good native support for HTTPS and JSON.

-   The Android system uses JSONObject and JSONArray to assemble and
    parse JSON objects and arrays, and HttpURLConnection to initiate
    HTTPS requests.

-   The iOS system uses NSJSONSerialization to assemble and parse JSON
    data, and URLSession to initiate HTTPS requests.

Of course, you can also use third-party HTTPS and JSON libraries.
