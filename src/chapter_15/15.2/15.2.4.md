# Customising Logs of Interest

`esp_log` is the default logging component in ESP-IDF. Typically, `ESP_LOGE` and `ESP_LOGW` are used to log errors and warnings in the firmware. All logs recorded using the `esp_log` component are tracked by the Insights agent and reported to the ESP Insights cloud. This allows developers to view these errors through the ESP Insights Dashboard, providing detailed information about what may be going on.

Developers can configure the log level by calling `esp_diag_log_hook_enable()` and `esp_diag_log_hook_disable()`.

```c
/*enable tracking error logs*/
esp_diag_log_hook_enable(ESP_DIAG_LOG_TYPE_ERROR);

/*enable tracking all log levels*/
esp_diag_log_hook_enable(ESP_DIAG_LOG_TYPE_ERROR|ESP_DIAG_LOG_TYPE_WARNING|ESP_DIAG_LOG_TYPE_EVENT);

/*disable tracking custom events*/
esp_diag_log_hook_disable(ESP_DIAG_LOG_TYPE_EVENT);
```

Normally, some error or warning logs are printed before the device
crashes, which are hard to be reported to the cloud. ESP Insights agent
provides a way to keep the logs and report them to the ESP Insights
cloud after boot-up. ESP32-C3 is equipped with RTC memory. The Insights
agent uses this memory to store the critical errors that occurred in the
system. On any boot-up, the Insights agent will check for any unreported
errors from the previous boot-up through this RTC memory and report that
to the ESP Insights cloud.
