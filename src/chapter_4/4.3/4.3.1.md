# Basic Concepts of Compilation System
An ESP-IDF project is a collection of a main program with an entry
function and multiple independent functional components. For example, a
project that controls LED switches mainly consists of an entry program
`main` and a `driver` component that controls GPIO. If you want to
realise the LED remote control, you also need to add Wi-Fi, TCP/IP
protocol stack, etc.

The compilation system can compile, link, and generate executable files
(.bin) for the code through a set of building rules. The compilation
system of ESP-IDF v4.0 and above versions is based on CMake by default,
and the compilation script `CMakeLists.txt` can be used to control the
compilation behavior of the code. In addition to supporting the basic
syntax of CMake, the ESP-IDF compilation system also defines a set of
default compilation rules and CMake functions, and you can write the
compilation script with simple statements.
