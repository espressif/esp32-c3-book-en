# ESP-IDF Git Workflow
Espressif follows a specific Git workflow for ESP-IDF, outlined as
follows:

New changes are made on the `master` branch, which serves as the
main development branch. The ESP-IDF version on the `master` branch
always carries a `-dev` tag to indicate that it is currently under
development, such as `v4.3-dev`. Changes on the `master` branch will
first be reviewed and tested in Espressif's internal repository, and
then pushed to GitHub after automated testing is complete.

Once a new version has completed feature development on the `master`
branch and met the criteria for entering beta testing, it
transitions to a new branch, such as `release/v4.3`. In addition, this new branch is tagged as a pre-release
version, like `v4.3-beta1`. Developers can refer to the GitHub
platform to access the complete list of branches and tags for
ESP-IDF. It's important to note that the beta version (pre-release
version) may still have a significant number of known issues. As the
beta version undergoes continuous testing, bug fixes are added to
both this version and the `master` branch simultaneously. Meanwhile,
the `master` branch may have already begun developing new features
for the next version. When testing is nearly complete, a release
candidate (`rc`) label is added to the branch, indicating that it is
a potential candidate for the official release, such as `v4.3-rc1`.
At this stage, the branch remains a pre-release version.

If no major bugs are discovered or reported, the pre-release version
eventually receives a major version label (e.g., v5.0) or a minor
version label (e.g., v4.3) and becomes an official release version,
which is documented in the release notes page. Subsequently, any
bugs identified in this version are fixed on the release branch.
After manual testing is completed, the branch is assigned a bug-fix
version label (e.g., v4.3.2), which is also reflected on the release
notes page.
