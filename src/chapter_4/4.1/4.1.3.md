# Choosing a Suitable Version
Since ESP-IDF officially began supporting ESP32-C3 from version v4.3,
and v4.4 has not yet been officially released at the time of writing
this book, the version used in this book is v4.3.2, which is a revised
version of v4.3. However, it is important to note that by the time you
read this book, v4.4 or newer versions may already be available. When
selecting a version, we recommend the following:

-   For **entry-level developers**, it is advisable to choose the stable
    v4.3 version or its revised version, which aligns with the example
    version used in this book.

-   For **mass production** purposes, it is recommended to use the
    latest stable version to to benefit from the most up-to-date
    technical support.

-   If you intend to experiment with **new chips** or explore **new
    product features**, please use the `master` branch. The latest
    version contains all the latest features, but keep in mind that
    there may be known or unknown bugs present.

-   If the stable version being used does not include the desired new
    features and you wish to **minimise the risks** associated with the
    `master` branch, consider using the corresponding release branch,
    such as the `release/v4.4` branch. Espressif's GitHub repository
    will first create the `release/v4.4` branch and subsequently release
    the stable v4.4 version based on a specific historical snapshot of
    this branch, after completing all feature development and testing.
