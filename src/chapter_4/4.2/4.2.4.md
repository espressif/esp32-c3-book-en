# Installing VS Code
By default, the ESP-IDF SDK does not include a code editing tool (though
the latest ESP-IDF installer for Windows offers the option to install
ESP-IDF Eclipse). You can use any text editing tool of your choice to
edit the code and then compile it using terminal commands.

One popular code editing tool is VS Code (Visual Studio Code), which is
a free and feature-rich code editor with a user-friendly interface. It
offers various plugins that provide functionalities such as code
navigation, syntax highlighting, Git version control, and terminal
integration. Additionally, Espressif has developed a dedicated plugin
called Espressif IDF for VS Code, which simplifies project configuration
and debugging.

You can use the `code` command in the terminal to quickly open the current folder in VS Code. Alternatively, you can use the shortcut `Ctrl+~` to open the systemâ€™s default terminal console within VS Code.
