# Compiling the Blink Program

This section takes the Blink program as an example to demonstrate the
compilation process of a simple ESP-IDF program. It is important to note
that this section uses the high/low level of GPIO to drive the LED.
However, the WS2812 indicator light requires a special communication
protocol. You can refer to the example program in [`esp-idf/examples/peripherals/rmt/led_strip`](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/examples/peripherals/rmt/led_strip) for more information.

### 1. Open a new terminal and import the ESP-IDF environment variables

For Linux and Mac systems, use `cd ~/esp/esp-idf` to navigate to the
ESP-IDF folder. Then, import the ESP-IDF environment variables using the
command `. ./export.sh`. This process also performs a complete integrity
check of the development environment.

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip**
>
> Please note that the **dot** before the space should not be omitted in `. ./export.sh`. The dot is equivalent to the `source` directive, which refers to executing the script and changing the environment variables in the current shell.

For Windows systems, you can directly find and open ESP-IDF 4.3 CMD or
ESP-IDF 4.3 PowerShell in the program list. After the terminal is
opened, the environment variables will be automatically added, as shown
in Figure 4.16.

### 2. Navigate to the root directory of the `blink` project

Before compiling the project, navigate to the root directory of the
project. To do this, use the command `cd examples/get-started/blink`.

### 3. Set the compilation target to ESP32-C3

Use the command `idf.py set-target esp32c3` to set the compilation
target to ESP32-C3, as shown in Figure 4.17. If this step is skipped,
the compilation target defaults to ESP32.

### 4. Configure GPIOs

Use the command `idf.py menuconfig` to enter the configuration
interface. Navigate using the up/down keys and press Enter key to enter
the `Example Configuration`. Enter a number to change the GPIO to the
specified pin, as shown in Figure 4.18. Save the configuration by
following the prompts.

### 5. Build the code

Use the command `idf.py build` to build the code. The code building
process is shown in Figure 4.19. Relevant prompts and flash commands
will be printed once the build is complete, as shown in Figure 4.20.
