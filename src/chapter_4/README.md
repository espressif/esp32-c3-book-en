# Setting Up Development Environment
This chapter focuses on ESP-IDF, the official software development
framework for ESP32-C3. We'll explain how to set up the environment on
various operating systems, and introduce the project structure and build
system of ESP-IDF, as well as the usage of related development tools.
Then we'll present the compiling and running process of an example
project, while offering a detailed explanation of the output log at each
stage.
