# Summary
In this chapter, we have covered the setup of the official software
development environment, ESP-IDF, for ESP32-C3. We have introduced the
code resources and file structure of ESP-IDF and provided a
demonstration of the ESP-IDF project structure, compilation system, and
related development tools using a simple example.

By following the instructions in this chapter, you can start developing
with ESP-IDF for simple projects. However, for more specific and
advanced compilation requirements, it is recommended to refer to both
the ESP-IDF official documentation and the CMake official documentation.
