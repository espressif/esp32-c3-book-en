# Summary

In this chapter, we introduced the mass production testing of products
based on Espressif's modules and chips, and the burning of mass
production firmware, so that readers can have a preliminary
understanding of mass production. For devices to be identified and bound
to users, unique mass production data must be burned to each device. To
save manufacturers' trouble of burning firmware in mass production,
Espressif provides modules with customized firmware, which can be
mounted directly onto the product's hardware circuit.
