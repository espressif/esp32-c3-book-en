# Firmware Burning and Testing for Mass Production

After the development stage, it is time for pilot-run verification tests
and mass production. Pilot-run verification tests include:

### EVT (Engineering Verification Test)

An EVT is performed on the first PCBA (Printed Circuit Board Assembly)
to ensure that basic designs meet requirements and specifications,
including basic hardware functions, RF performance, RF interference, and
power consumption. The EVT process may iterate as many times as required
to identify and fix all the issues.

### DVT (Design Verification Test)

A DVT is performed on the whole product to ensure that the product meets
requirements and specifications before moving towards mass production.
DVT includes high/low temperature test, electrostatic discharge (ESD)
test, and drop test.

### Product Certification

Once the product passes EVT and DVT, a prototype can be prepared for
national or alliance certifications, such as SRRC, FCC, CE, etc.

After trial production, the product is ready for mass production. Mass
production involves many stages, such as material preparation, mounting,
burning, testing, packaging, etc. This chapter only focuses on two
stages that are closely related to Espressif's products &ndash; firmware
burning and product testing.
