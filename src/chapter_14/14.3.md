# üßê Practice: Mass Production Data in Smart Light Project

In the Smart Light project introduced in this book, each device needs to
store some unique information for identification, as well as some common
configuration for operation. The public ESP RainMaker used in the
project is for prototyping and evaluation, which only allows adding five
devices at most. You can generate binary files of mass production data
based on obtained credentials and modify relevant source codes to
stimulate the operations in mass production. To get the Cloud
connectivity credentials of a larger scale, please contact Espressif for
private ESP RainMaker deployments.
