# User Management

The user management features allow end users to register, log in, change passwords, retrieve passwords, etc.

### Register and log in

The registration and login methods supported by RainMaker include:

- Email id + Password
- Phone number + Password
- Google account
- Apple account
- GitHub account (public server only)
- Amazon account (private server only)

> ðŸ“Œ **Note**

> Sign up using Google/Amazon shares the user's email address with RainMaker. Sign up using Apple shares a dummy address that Apple assigns for the user specifically for the RainMaker service. A RainMaker account will be automatically created for users signing in with a Google, Apple, or Amazon account for the first time.

### Change password

Valid only for Email id/Phone number based logins. All other active sessions will be logged out after password is changed. As per AWS Cognito behaviour, the logged-out sessions can stay active upto 1 hour.

### Retrieve password

Valid only for Email id/Phone number based logins.
