# Claiming Service

All communication between RainMaker devices and the cloud backend is carried out through MQTT+TLS. In the context of ESP RainMaker, "Claiming" is the process in which devices obtain certificates from the Claiming Service to connect to the cloud backend. Note that Claiming Service is only applicable to the public RainMaker service, while for private deployment, the device certificates need to be generated in bulk through Admin CLI. ESP RainMaker supports three types of Claiming Service:

### Self Claiming

The device itself fetches the certificates through a secret key pre-programmed in eFuse after connecting to the Internet.

### Host Driven Claiming

The certificates are obtained from the development host with the RainMaker account.

### Assisted Claiming

The certificates are obtained via smartphone applications during provisioning.
