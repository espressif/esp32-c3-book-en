# Firmware Upgrade and Version Management

The firmware update of IoT devices is often implemented through OTA
(Over-the-Air). OTA provides a secure and dependable means to remediate
firmware vulnerabilities, introduce novel functions, and optimize
product performance, thereby enhancing the experience of end users. At
present, OTA has become a standard function in the mass production of
products.

Marking firmware with different versions based on their respective
functionalities is a reliable and effective means of firmware
management. Standardized methods of version marking can facilitate
version management, aid in troubleshooting, and enable efficient
post-upgrade tracking, ultimately leading to more effective firmware
updates via OTA.

ESP-IDF provides an example of OTA and various firmware version
management methods. This chapter will cover these topics and demonstrate
how to achieve remote OTA for an intelligent lamp using ESP RainMaker.
