# Power-on Sequence and System Reset

ESP32-C3 uses a 3.3 V system power supply. The chip should be activated after the power rails have stabilised. This is achieved by delaying the activation of pin 7 CHIP_EN after the 3.3 V rails have been brought up. Figure 5.7 shows the power-up and reset timing of ESP32-C3. Details about the parameters are listed in Table 5.2.

To ensure that the power supply to ESP32-C3 is stable during power-up, it is advised to add an RC delay circuit at the CHIP_EN pin. The recommended setting for the RC delay circuit is usually *R = 10 k&Omega;* and *C = 1 μF*, while specific parameters should be adjusted based on the power-up timing of the power supply and the power-up and reset sequence timing of the chip.

CHIP_EN can also be used as the reset pin of ESP32-C3. When CHIP_EN is
at low level, the reset voltage (*V*<sub>IL_nRST</sub>) should be (-0.3 ~ 0.25) × *V*<sub>DD</sub> (where *V*<sub>DD</sub> is the I/O voltage for a particular power domain of pins). To avoid reboots caused by external interference, route the CHIP_EN trace as short as possible, and add a pull-up resistor as well as a capacitor to ground. Note that CHIP_EN pin must not be left floating.
