# Guidelines for Power Supply Design

When powering up the ESP32-C3 module through a single pin, the power supply should be of 3.3 V with 500 mA or larger current output. Power ripples can significantly affect the RF TX performance. Generally, the peak value of the ripple should be less than 80 mV when transmitting IEEE 802.11n MCS7 packets, and less than 120 mV when transmitting at 11 Mbit/s.
