# Wi-Fi Connection in Smart Light Project
After learning the basics of Wi-Fi connection, we may put it into
practice based on ESP32-C3, and encapsulate the Wi-Fi features according
to application requirements, so as to provide APIs for Wi-Fi
initialisation and Wi-Fi connection initialisation.

### Driver initialisation

This API specifies parameters for ESP32-C3, such as GPIO pins, fading
time, breathing cycle, PWM frequency, clock source of the PWM
controller, and PWM duty cycle resolution. For details, please refer to
Chapter 5.

```c
app_driver_init();
```

### NVS initialisation

Before initialising Wi-Fi, it is necessary to initialise the NVS library
as the Wi-Fi component needs to acquire and store certain parameters.
The API is as follows:

```c
nvs_flash_init();
```

### Wi-Fi initialisation

This API handles LwIP and Wi-Fi events, and initialises Wi-Fi drivers.

```c
wifi_initialize();
```

### Wi-Fi connection initialisation

This API implements Wi-Fi configuration, starts the Wi-Fi driver, and
waits for Wi-Fi connection to complete.

```c
wifi_station_initialize();
```

> To code for Wi-Fi connection based on the LED dimming driver project,
> refer to [`book-esp32c3-iot-projects/device_firmware/3_wifi_connection`](https://github.com/espressif/book-esp32c3-iot-projects/tree/main/device_firmware/3_wifi_connection).

You may compile and run the code on the development board. The output is
as follows:

```shell
I (397) wifi station: Application driver initialization
