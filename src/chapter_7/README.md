# Wi-Fi Configuration and Connection
In this chapter, we'll focus on the specifications of Wi-Fi network
configuration and connection, from the basics of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to
the common methods for configuring Wi-Fi network. Then, examples will be
given to help you better understand its operating mechanism, and ways of
smart Wi-Fi configuration. Finally, we'll lead you to a practice of
smart Wi-Fi configuration with the Smart Light project based on

history, many documents have delved deeply into this topic. Therefore,
this chapter will only provide a brief introduction. For details, please
