# Summary
In this chapter, we first introduced two important technologies for
network configuration of IoT devices, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Then we
covered some concepts and mechanisms of Wi-Fi network configuration,
including SoftAP, SmartConfig, Bluetooth, direct network configuration,
RouterConfig, ZeroConfig, and phone AP network configuration. We also
analysed the code for SoftAP, SmartConfig, and Bluetooth network
configuration, combined with Wi-Fi programming. Finally, we tried out
smart Wi-Fi configuration with the Smart Light project.
