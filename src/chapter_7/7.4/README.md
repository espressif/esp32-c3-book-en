# Wi-Fi Programming
This section provides an overview of Wi-Fi APIs, covering how to use the
APIs, to establish STA connection, and to connect in a smart way.

When developing a Wi-Fi application, the most efficient way is to adapt
a similar example for your own requirements. Therefore, if you want to
create a robust application, we suggest that you read this section and
do the practices before getting started with your own project.
