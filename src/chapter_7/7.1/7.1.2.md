# Evolution of IEEE 802.11
As Wi-Fi users, we should have heard about IEEE 802.11 more or less. But
what does it exactly mean?

**IEEE** is the abbreviation of the Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers. **802** is a committee in the institute for
networking standards, also known as the LMSC &ndash; LAN/MAN Standards
Committee. The committee covers such a big family of standards that it
needs to be divided into groups devoted to specific areas. Each group
has its own number (the one following "802", separated by a dot), so
**802.11** refers to the 11th group of committee 802, which develops the
Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols and Physical Layer (PHY)
specifications of wireless local area networks (WLANs). IEEE 802.11 has
experienced several "amendments", as shown in Table 7.1.
