# Introduction to Wi-Fi

Wi-Fi is a trademark of wireless communication technology owned by the
Wi-Fi Alliance (WFA), which supervises Wi-Fi certification. It is a
family of wireless network protocols based on the IEEE 802.11 standards.
Products passing rigorous testings will be given the Wi-Fi CERTIFIEDâ„¢
seal to prove that they have met industry-agreed standards for
interoperability, security, and a range of application specific
protocols.

Compared with other wireless communication technologies, Wi-Fi boasts
wider coverage, better penetrating ability through walls, and higher
throughput.
