A new section? Really?? Tell us more! 👏

To help you clarify your writing ideas, here is a checklist for you to plan the content of the section better. Please read the instructions carefully and fill in the outline. **Keep all your input *italic*.**

- [ ] [Section title](#section-title)
- [ ] [Description](#description)
- [ ] [Subsection titles](#subsection-titles-3-5-subsections)
- [ ] [Skills learned](#skills-learned)
- [ ] [Materials (Optional)](#materials-optional)
- [ ] [References (Optional)](#references-optional)

## Section title
> Keep the style of the title in line with the existing ones in this chapter. Actionable names are recommended for section titles. Verbs like installing, setting, implementing, understanding, etc. wherever applicable make for a great addition as they help the readers understand what they are going to learn from this section.
>
> Keep an appropriate length of the title. 3-5 words would be preferred.

### *[Replace/with/your/title]*

## Description
> We may think about the following questions before writing:
> - What will be discussed and what will we do in this section?
> - Why people want to learn it? (What's new? Why important?)
>
> Introduce the section in 2-3 sentences.

## Subsection titles (3-5 subsections)
> Same as section titles, actionable names are also recommended for subsection titles. Make clear what readers are going to learn from the subsection.
>
> Keep an appropriate length of the title. 3-5 words would be preferred.

## Skills learned
