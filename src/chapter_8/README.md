# Local Control

In Chapter 7, we learnt about basics of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, as well as several common network configuration methods. Through the introduction and practice in Chapter 7, you should be able to configure devices and connect them to Wi-Fi routers. On this basis, this chapter will introduce how to implement local control of devices based on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and realize local control with ESP32-C3. It is intended to explain the definition and process of local control, along with some common local control communication protocols, and help you to build your own local control framework for smart lights based on ESP32-C3.
