# Enhanced Device Security Features

The security of data is a complex and ever-evolving research topic. This
chapter aims to provide readers with a foundational understanding of
data security. In Section 13.1, we will discuss the threats that can
compromise the security of IoT device data and introduce the basic
framework for data protection. Section 13.2 presents a scheme for
verifying the integrity of IoT device firmware data. Section 13.3
introduces two encryption schemes - Flash Encryption and NVS
Encryption - that ensure data confidentiality. Section 13.4 outlines the
Secure Boot scheme, which safeguards the legitimacy of IoT device
firmware data. Finally, Section 13.5 examines the effectiveness of
combining the Flash Encryption and Secure Boot schemes and provides
guidance on how to enable these schemes in device mass production.
