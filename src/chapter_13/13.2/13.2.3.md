# Example

The Linux system integrates various tools for calculating checksums,
such as `sha256sum` and `md5sum`. We can use these tools to calculate
the checksum of specified files, and compare the changes of the
checksums before and after modifying the file. Below commands use
`md5sum` to calculate the checksums of the `hello.c` file before and
after modification:

<pre><code>$ <b>md5sum hello.c</b>
87cb921a75d4211a57ba747275e8bbe6 //Original MD5 checksum of hello.c
$ <b>md5sum hello.c</b>
79c3416910f9ea0d65a72cb720368416 //New MD5 checksum after adding one line
</code></pre>

It can be seen that modifying just one line of code in the original file
will result in greatly different MD5 checksums.
