# Enabling Flash Encryption and Secure Boot in Smart Light Project

Different from other solutions presented in this book, flash encryption
and secure boot can be used almost "out of the box", without the need
for additional coding. These security schemes can be conveniently
enabled by configuring the `menuconfig` settings. For a smart lighting
system, we recommend using flash encryption, NVS encryption, and
hardware secure boot simultaneously to enhance the overall device
security to its maximum potential.
