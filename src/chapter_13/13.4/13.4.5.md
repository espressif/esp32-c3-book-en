# Examples

The secure boot solution features have been seamlessly integrated into
ESP-IDF. By familiarising yourself with the implementation principles
and configuring the appropriate options in the `menuconfig`, you can
easily enable these features according to your requirements. In
comparison to the software secure boot solution, the hardware secure
boot provides a more comprehensive verification of firmware validity.
Thus, it is recommended to utilise the hardware secure boot solution to
enhance device security during the mass production stage. This section
will present several examples of enabling hardware secure boot, which
can be utilised for testing purposes. Furthermore, if you encounter any
errors while sending new firmware to the device using hardware secure
boot, the following log messages can serve as a reference for
troubleshooting.

When hardware secure boot is enabled according to the steps described in
13.4.4, starting up the device for the first time will get the following
log message:

```console
I (10251) secure_boot_v2: Secure boot V2 is not enabled yet and eFsue digest  keys are not set
I (10256) secure_boot_v2: Verifying with RSA-PSS...
I (10254) secure_boot_v2: Signature verified successfully!
I (10272) boot: boot: Loaded app from partition at offset 0X120000
I (10274) secure_boot_v2: Enabling secure boot V2...
```

Re-powering up the device will get the following message:

```console
ESP-ROM:esp32c3-api1-20210207
Build:Feb 7 2021
rst:0x1 (POWERON),boot:0xC(SPI_FAST_FLASH_BOOT)
SPIWP:0xee
mode:DIO, clock div:1
Valid Secure Boot key blocks: 0
Secure Boot verification succeeded

load:0x403ce000,len:0x928
load:0x403d0000,len:0x4ce4
entry 0x403ce000
I (71) boot: ESP-IDF v4.3.2-2741-g7c0fa3fc70 2nd stage bootloader
```

Flashing unsigned bootloader to the device will get the following error
message and terminate boot process.

```console
ESP-ROM:esp32c3-api1-20210207
Build:Feb 7 2021
rst:0x1 (POWERON),boot:0xC(SPI_FAST_FLASH_BOOT)
SPIWP:0xee
mode:DIO, clock div:1
Valid secure boot key blocks: 0
No signature block magic byte found at signature sector (found 0xcd not 0xe7). 
Image not V2 signed?
secure boot verification failed
ets_main.c 333
```

Flashing unsigned app firmware to the device will get the following
error message and terminate boot process.

```console
I (310) esp_image: Verifying image signature...
I (312) secure_boot_v2: Verifying with RSA-PSS...
No signature block magic byte found at signature sector (found 0x41 not 0xe7). 
Image not V2 signed?
E (326) secure_boot_v2: Secure Boot V2 verification failed.
E (332) esp_image: Secure boot signature verification failed
I (339) esp_image: Calculating simple hash to check for corruption...
W (418) esp_image: image valid, signature bad
```

Sending unsigned app firmware to the device through OTA upgrade will
cause signature verification failure, thus ending the data transmission,
and preventing firmware loading.

```console
I (4487) simple_ota_example: Starting OTA example
