# Summary

In this chapter, we first introduced ESP32-C3's power management feature
and supported low-power modes (Modem-sleep, Light-sleep, Deep-sleep
modes), then described how to perform low-power debugging, and, at last,
concluded how to use the power management feature and low-power modes to
reduce power consumption and how to measure actual power consumption,
using a smart light project as an example.
