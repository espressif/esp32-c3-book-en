# Translating for the community

We welcome translations for the sections in this book!

## Guidelines

There are folders in each chapter folder which contain the translated markdown files. Create folders for your language if there are no existing ones. We look forward to translations of vaious languages. ü§© 

> **Note**
>
> Please do not translate anything in the code blocks. Translations of pictures are appeciated. Check [pic-translation.xlsx](src/Pics/pic-translation.xlsx) to see the fiugre translations required.

Translated files should follow this naming convention:

**README._[language]_.md**

where _[language]_ is a two letter language abbreviation following the [ISO 639-1 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) (e.g., `README.ru.md` for Russian and `README.de.md` for German).

> **Note**
>
> - Almost each chapter and section has a README.md in this book. Make sure that you put the translated README.md in the right folder to avoid file conflicts.
>
> - When including figures, you may need to add `../../` to the beginning of the source path in order to retrieve the figure correctly.

If your translation is adopted, we will mark the credit at the end of the file as in

> Translated by *XX (Linked to your personal profile, if provided.)*
